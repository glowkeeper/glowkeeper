*Where code, creativity, and curiosity meet.*

---

**Exploring the frontier between technology, teaching, and creativity — by building and publishing tools, stories, research, and systems.**

---

## Current Focus  

I’m currently focused on weaving together (1) practical software artefacts and games, (2) conceptual research, and (3) generative creative work. I aim to keep shipping projects that test ideas, push boundaries, and teach me new things.

## Active Projects  

Here are a few of the things I’m actively working on (or close to it). These are not marketing blurbs — just what I’m aiming to build or explore.

| Project | Purpose / what I’m trying to learn or test |
|---|---|
| **Quizmo** | [Quizmo](https://quizmo.fun/) throws 10 rapid-fire questions your way. Think fast. Tap faster. Dominate the layouts. Quizmo awaits |
| **StoryMaker** | [StoryMaker](https://huckle.studio/storymaker/) is ai-based text generation |
| **Intro to 3D Games** | [3D Games in Unity](https://github.com/glowkeeper/IntroToBuilding3DGamesInUnity) - the first of a series of workshops aimed at teaching people to build 3D games, using [Unity](https://unity.com/) |

If you browse my repo list, you’ll see many experiments and sub‑tools branching off these ideas.

## Curated Core Stack  

These are the main tools, frameworks, languages, or patterns I lean on or return to frequently:

- **JavaScript / TypeScript / React / NextJS** (for web, dApps, front-end logic)
- **Node / Payload** (for backend, full-stack apps)
- **Markdown + Pandoc + LaTeX** (for writing papers and presentations)  
- **Git / GitHub** (version control, publishing, open source)  
- **Design Science Research / iterative prototyping** (as methodological backbone)  
- **Basic tools & scripts** for glue logic (shell scripts, node utilities, minimal frameworks)  
- **Solidity / Ethereum / smart contracts** (for token logic and decentralised systems)  

I don’t aim to use every trendy tool (though I do stay up to date) — I prefer simple, composable, transparent stacks where I understand the plumbing intimately.

---

## What I’m Learning (or Want to Learn Next)  

- More functional expressions of React/NextJS/JavaScript
- AI tooling
- Different platforms for publishing games
- Better workflows for “writing-as-code” (i.e. integrating narrative, docs, code, experiments)  
- Experimenting with generative creative systems (poetry, stories) that embed or interact with software  
- Scaling research ideas into usable systems (bridging prototype → production)
- Deeper models of tokenomics, especially coupling real-world signals (e.g. energy use) to on‑chain behaviour  
- More advanced formal verification or safety tools (especially for smart contracts)

## How to Reach Dr Huckle  

- Website/portfolio: [https://huckle.studio](https://huckle.studio/)
- GitHub: [glowkeeper](https://github.com/glowkeeper) 
- (Optionally) via academic email or via the [contact](https://huckle.studio/about/contact) page on huckle.studio  

I’m generally open to discussion, collaboration, critique, or sharing ideas.

## (Optional) Guiding Principle  

> *“Ship small bets, and learn fast.”*

I try to avoid large speculative dead ends — instead, build many small prototypes, learn from failure, and grow the ones that resonate.
